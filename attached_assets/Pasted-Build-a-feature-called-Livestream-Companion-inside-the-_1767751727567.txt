Build a feature called Livestream Companion inside the Christian World app. This feature enhances livestream worship and sermon viewing using AI transcription, verse recognition, hymn detection, and timestamped note-taking. It must work with both live streams and uploaded sermon videos.

🎯 Purpose

The Livestream Companion should allow users to:

Watch livestream or recorded sermons

View real-time AI transcription

Automatically detect Bible verses referenced in the sermon

Automatically detect hymns or worship songs being sung

Take timestamped notes tied to the video

Save notes, highlights, verses, and hymns into the user’s Library

Re-open saved items and jump to the original video moment

Rename the “Sermons” section to:

Livestream Companion

everywhere in the app.

🔹 Core UI Layout
Main Screen Structure

Top: Video player (supports livestream + uploaded video)

Bottom / Side: Companion Panel with tabs:

📖 Verses

🎵 Hymns

📝 Notes

📜 Transcript

The panel updates in real-time as the livestream plays.

🤖 AI Features
1️⃣ AI Transcription

AI must:

Convert livestream audio to real-time transcript

Timestamp each transcript line

Save the transcript to the database

Allow scrolling and playback syncing

Allow tap-to-seek:

tapping a transcript line jumps to that moment

Users can search inside the transcript.

2️⃣ AI Bible Verse Detection

AI should:

Detect when a Bible passage is referenced verbally

Support:

“John three sixteen”

“John 3:16”

paraphrase mentions

Pull the correct scripture from the Bible database

Display verses in the Verses tab

Show the timestamp when first mentioned

Allow user actions:

When saved, store:

verse reference

Saved highlights must appear in:

Library → Highlights

and link back to both the Bible passage and video timestamp.

3️⃣ AI Hymn / Song Detection

The AI should:

Detect when a hymn or worship song is sung

Attempt to match it to the hymns catalog

If matched:

display hymn title + lyrics

link to hymn audio if available

If NOT matched:

transcribe lyrics live

display transcription

Users can:

add timestamped notes

Hymn-related notes are stored in Library.

📝 Notes System (Must Be Deeply Integrated)

Users must be able to create timestamped notes in three contexts:

A. General Livestream Notes

open Notes tab

free type

automatically attach timestamp

B. Verse-Linked Notes

notes saved while viewing a verse

must attach:

video id

C. Hymn-Linked Notes

same as above but hymn-based

📚 Library Integration Requirements
