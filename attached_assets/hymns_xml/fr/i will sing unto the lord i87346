<lyrics>[V1]
 I will sing unto the Lord, for He is worthy to be praised.
 I will sing unto the Lord, and bless His holy name.
 I will sing unto the Lord, for He is worthy to be praised.
 I will sing unto the Lord, and bless His holy name.

[C1]
   You are holy, you are righteous,
   You are magnificent, You are victorious,
   You are mighty, You are omnipotent.
   There is none that can compare,
   I've come to bless His name.

[B1]
   Bless His Name, Bless His Name,
   Let everybody come and Bless His Name</lyrics>
